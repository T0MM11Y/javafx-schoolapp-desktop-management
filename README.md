# JavaFX School Desktop Application

This project is a robust and user-friendly desktop application designed for managing various school-related activities. Leveraging the JavaFX framework, the application delivers a modern, visually appealing interface that enhances user experience and accessibility. The system is structured following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, promoting clean code organization, modularity, and ease of maintenance.

The application enables users—such as school administrators, teachers, and students—to efficiently perform tasks like managing student and teacher data, handling logins with role-based access, and navigating essential school functions. With intuitive navigation and clear visual cues, users can quickly access features for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, session management, and more. 

JavaFX’s rich set of UI components ensures an interactive and responsive environment, making daily administrative and academic operations more streamlined. The project exemplifies best practices in desktop app development, combining visual clarity with flexible, maintainable code.

Below are some snapshots that illustrate key features and user flows within the application:
